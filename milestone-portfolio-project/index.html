      <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p> With a strong background in research and design, I take the time to find
      your unique story and transform it into a beautiful website. I use HTML, CSS, Photoshop, and Sketch to create
      stunning layouts that you can customize to your likeing.</p>
      <p> I used to be a professional dancer, and dance was concerned about first impressions,
        presentation, and art, which is why I have such a keen eye for design.</p>
        <p> My best skills focus on UI/UX design using Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, and programing via HTML, CSS, and Java.</p>

        <h4>Alexandra Ballet Website</h4>
        <img src="" alt="Ballet Website" />
      <p> Ballet is a highly visual field and in order to portray this visual
        I worked with the client to create a beautiful website that focused more
        on visuals and less on words. The website had some problems and I thought
        it was necessary to bring it into the 21st century.</p>
        <p>I also wanted to make sure that this website was user friendly. We had to think
          what the user wanted out of visiting this website. First and foremost,
          the students of the school needed a place to look at their class schedules,
          their rehersal schedules, and different notes. Then we thought about people
          who might be intrestead in putting their child in dance. That's why
          we focused on so much imagry. Usinig some stockphotos as well as
          photos from the school I transformed this website.</p>

          <h4>E-commerce Website</h4>
          <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
          <p>This project focuses on an e-commerce store. The store wanted to
            focus on styles the user could trust. I attempted to use color to
            convey a sense of sophstication. I focused on colors like gray and
            light pink. These combined with the bright pictures of the clothes
            convey fun and sophisticated, which is what the client was looking for.</p>
            <p>In addition, I wanted to have ease of navigation. Nothing is more frustrating
              than having a website for a business with poor navigation. The client wanted
              to have a clear map for information. So, the menu bar focuses on
              giving the client the ability to easily navigate the site. In addition,
              I included embeddded links so that by clicking on graphics you
              can transition to other areas of the site.</p>

            <h4>Fashion and Travel Bloger's Website</h4>
            <p>I happened to know a woman intrestead in pursuing a fashion
              and travel blog. I thought with all the bright colors in her pictures
              she'd need something to balance the photos. We choose bright colors
              to convey a sense of happieness and friendliness. In order to show
              sophistication we used typography that was sleek and modern.</p>
              <p>The logo represents the background my client comes from. She's
                part Chineese part American. As such I took elements from both
                worlds and combined them into a beautiful logo.</p>
              <p>Finally we incorporated maps, images, and videos to create
                a playful and interactive design.</p>
