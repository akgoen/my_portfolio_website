	<h3>Past Work</h3>
  <h4>Alexandra Ballet Website</h4>
  <img src="" alt="Ballet Website" />
  <p> Ballet is a highly visual field and in order to portray this visual
    I worked with the client to create a beautiful website that focused more
    on visuals and less on words. The website had some problems and I thought
    it was necessary to bring it into the 21st century.</p>
  <p>I also wanted to make sure that this website was user friendly. We had to think
    what the user wanted out of visiting this website. First and foremost,
    the students of the school needed a place to look at their class schedules,
    their rehersal schedules, and different notes. Then we thought about people
    who might be intrestead in putting their child in dance. That's why
    we focused on so much imagry. Usinig some stockphotos as well as
    photos from the school I transformed this website.</p>

<div class="third-width">
  <h4>E-commerce Website</h4>

	<img src="img/hog2.png" alt="House of Goen store page" />
	<img src="img/hog3.png" alt="House of Goen mission statement" />
  <p>This project focuses on an e-commerce store. The store wanted to
    focus on styles the user could trust. I attempted to use color to
    convey a sense of sophstication. I focused on colors like gray and
    light pink. These combined with the bright pictures of the clothes
    convey fun and sophisticated, which is what the client was looking for.</p>
  <p>In addition, I wanted to have ease of navigation. Nothing is more frustrating
    than having a website for a business with poor navigation. The client wanted
    to have a clear map for information. So, the menu bar focuses on
    giving the client the ability to easily navigate the site. In addition,
    I included embeddded links so that by clicking on graphics you
    can transition to other areas of the site.</p>
</div>
<div class="third-width">
  <h4>Fashion and Travel Bloger's Website</h4>
  <p>I happened to know a woman intrestead in pursuing a fashion
    and travel blog. I thought with all the bright colors in her pictures
    she'd need something to balance the photos. We choose bright colors
    to convey a sense of happieness and friendliness. In order to show
    sophistication we used typography that was sleek and modern.</p>
  <p>The logo represents the background my client comes from. She's
    part Chineese part American. As such I took elements from both
    worlds and combined them into a beautiful logo.</p>
  <p>Finally we incorporated maps, images, and videos to create
    a playful and interactive design.</p>
